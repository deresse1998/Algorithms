== Linear Data Structures

* By Implementation
    ** Linked list
    ** Vector
* By use
    ** Stack
    ** Queue
    ** Dequeue
    ** Priority queue is implemented with tree-like structures
* More complicated ones
    * Skip lists

=== Linked lists

[source,java]
----
class LinkedList<T> {
    private static class Node<T> {
        T data;
        Node next;
    }
    
}
----
=== Vectors

=== Stack

=== Queue, Circular queue

=== Priority queues and heaps

== Trees

== Searching structures

* Binary Search Trees
    ** Balancing
        *** 2-3 Trees
        *** Red-Black Trees
        *** AVL Trees
* Hash tables
* Multidimensional trees, tables
