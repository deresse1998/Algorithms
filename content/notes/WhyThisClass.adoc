= Why study algorithms ?

- You will learn many standard algorithms
- You will become better at solving programming problems
- Great for job interviews !!

== Standard algorithms

- Will review basic data structures (vectors/lists, trees, hash tables)
- Will review well-known algorithms (sorting etc)
- Will *really* learn graphs and graph algorithms
- Other more advanced ones
    - flow
    - probabilistic

== Problem solving

- Will learn techniques for solving problems and coming up with algorithms
- Divide and Conquer
- Greedy
- Dynamic programming

== Job interviews

- Most use some algorithmic problems
- May end up with one you know
- Will have more problems you know
- Will have techniques for coming up with solutions
- Some sites
